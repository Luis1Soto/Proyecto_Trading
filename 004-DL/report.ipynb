    "The limitations of logistic regression and SVM models lie in their inability to capture complex and non-linear relationships between input and output variables, as well as their sensitivity to the quality and quantity of training data, which can affect their ability to generalize adequately to new and unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "While it is possible to apply logistic regression and SVM models to predict the performance of stocks such as AAPL, it is important to consider the limitations and challenges associated with these models. Negative returns over time may be obtained due to the inherent complexity and volatility of the stock market, as well as the limitations of the models themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although machine learning-based strategies may offer opportunities to enhance performance and optimize investment decision-making, the results of this comparison underscore the need for critical analysis and deep understanding of the market and the models used. It is essential to consider not only the potential for gains but also the ability to mitigate risks and adapt to market volatility. Combining passive and algorithmic approaches may offer a balance that leverages the strengths of each approach and leads to more consistent and satisfying long-term results.\n",
